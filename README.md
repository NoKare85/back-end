# back-end

This project is a simple TODO application.
You can add, remove and modify tasks and assign them to different people.

The server application is implemented as Node.js and Express and connecting to MongoDB using mongoose

Front-end is built with express-handlebars and some custom javascript

Running the project:

-   clone the files and run 'npm install' to install depencies
-   add .env file to the root and set 'DATABASE_URL' to point to your database instance
-   use 'npm run dev' to run on dev mode using nodemon
-   use 'npm run start' to run production mode

The project is also running live on Heroku https://quiet-tundra-67029.herokuapp.com/

Have fun!
